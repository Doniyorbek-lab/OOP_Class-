TO BE HONEST I LOVED <<<GitHub>>>

These files are not in the cloud(your GitHub account)
	 3 steps to transfer them
1. git add . (for all changes) git add (name of file)
2. git status -> git commit -m "here your comment about changes"
3. git status 
4. git push // for sending to online cloud 

If you wanna get files in your online repository, with any changes
 you should type "pull"  
Your partner changed the project and you want to get it.

 - git pull // get project with changes to your local git bash
